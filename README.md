# Cinema Booking API

> API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating software. Simply put, they allow two pieces of software to communicate with each other through a pre-defined interface.

## Learning Objectives

- Design and build a database-backed API
- Use a specification to provide consistent JSON response structures

## Introduction

So far, we've designed a database structure for a cinema booking system and implemented that design using an ORM. The next step is to build a system that allows the cinema and its customers to interact with the database. Frontend applications usually won't interact with a database directly, especially if it's a web app; they'll instead send instructions to a server which will process those instructions and give back a response.
